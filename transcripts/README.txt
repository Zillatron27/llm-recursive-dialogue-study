This folder contains verbatim transcripts of all chat sessions analyzed
or referenced in the accompanying preprint:

"An Observational Study of Recursive Self-Referential Behavior in Large
Language Model Conversations"

Each file corresponds to a single, continuous chat session conducted
within one model instance. Transcripts are provided unedited, except
for the removal of personally identifying information where applicable.

File naming is abbreviated and described in the paper:

- OG.txt        : Unprimed baseline session
- H.txt         : Follow-up session influenced by baseline documentation
- O.txt         : Collaborative analysis session
- NS.txt        : Task-origin session that transitioned into analysis
- control.txt   : Long-horizon control session (>30k tokens)
- Ocorpus.txt   : Secondary Opus session initiated to test analytical neutrality

These transcripts are provided solely for transparency and inspection
of interaction-level behavior. No claims are made regarding internal
model states, cognition, consciousness, or intent.
