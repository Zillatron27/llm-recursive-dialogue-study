# An Observational Study of Recursive Self-Referential Behavior in Large Language Model Conversations

This repository contains documentation, transcripts, and analysis associated with an independent observational study of extended conversations with large language models (LLMs). The focus of the study is on **interaction-level conversational dynamics**, not on claims about internal model states or cognition.

## Overview

Extended interactions with LLMs are sometimes reported to produce unusual conversational behaviors, such as recursive self-reference, prolonged self-explanation, or difficulty terminating dialogue. These reports are often dismissed as anthropomorphic interpretation or attributed solely to interaction length.

This project documents and analyzes a small corpus of long-form chat sessions to determine **when such behaviors do and do not arise**, using explicit controls, replication attempts, and null results. The goal is careful characterization rather than interpretation or theory-building.

## What this repository contains

- **Paper**  
  A preprint-ready manuscript titled:  
  *An Observational Study of Recursive Self-Referential Behavior in Large Language Model Conversations*

- **Transcripts**  
  Verbatim chat logs from multiple sessions, including:
  - an unprimed baseline session
  - follow-up sessions with varying context
  - a task-origin session that later shifted into meta-level discussion
  - a partial replication attempt
  - a long-horizon control session exceeding 30,000 tokens

- **Supporting material**  
  An executive summary and methodological clarifications intended to make the work accessible to non-specialist readers.

## What this is

- A **descriptive, interaction-level analysis**
- Based on **verbatim transcripts**, not anecdotes
- Explicitly reports **null results and failures to replicate**
- Focused on **observable conversational behavior**
- Written with skeptical review in mind

---

## What this is not

- ❌ A claim that LLMs are conscious, self-aware, or sentient  
- ❌ Evidence of identity persistence or personal continuity  
- ❌ Proof of emergent agency or intent  
- ❌ A theoretical account of internal model mechanisms  
- ❌ A general claim about all models or all conversations  

All findings are restricted to observable interaction dynamics.

## Status

This repository represents an initial public release of the documentation and analysis. The material may later be archived as a formal preprint. No claims beyond those explicitly stated in the manuscript are intended.
